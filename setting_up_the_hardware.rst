Steps to set up hardware
========================

#. Get a sdcard of 4 GB or above

#. A USB Hub, keyboard and mouse

#. (OPTIONAL) For better debugging through ``minicom``, get serial port pins (Rx, Tx) out from the board. Use a level shifter and an USB to Serial converter if required.

#. A similar compatible board (`OLINUXINO <https://github.com/androportal/OLINUXINO>`_ ) can be found `here <https://github.com/androportal/OLINUXINO>`_
